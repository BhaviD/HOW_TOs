DELETING A BRANCH:
  - <remote branch>
  $ git push --delete origin <branch name>
  
  - <local branch>
  $ git branch -d branch_name
  
 MERGING A BRANCH TO MASTER:
  - switch to master branch in the local repo
  $ git checkout master
  - update local master with remote master
  $ git pull
  - merge the branch into local master. This may give you conflicts which need to be resolved 
    and changes committed before moving further.
  $ git merge <branch_name>
  $ git push
