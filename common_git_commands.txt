DELETING A BRANCH:
  - <remote branch>
  $ git push --delete origin <branch name>
  
  - <local branch>
  $ git branch -d branch_name
  
MERGING A BRANCH TO MASTER:
  - switch to master branch in the local repo
  $ git checkout master
  - update local master with remote master
  $ git pull
  - merge the branch into local master. This may give you conflicts which need to be resolved 
    and changes committed before moving further.
  $ git merge <branch_name>
  $ git push

REVERT PUSHED COMMITS
  # This will create three separate revert commits:
  $ git revert a867b4af 25eee4ca 0766c053

  # It also takes ranges. This will revert the last two commits:
  $ git revert HEAD~2..HEAD

  # Similarly, you can revert a range of commits using commit hashes (non inclusive of first hash):
  $ git revert 0d1d7fc..a867b4a

RENAME A BRANCH
  $ git checkout <old_name>
  
  # rename local branch
  $ git branch -m <new_name>
  
  # Push the <new_name> local branch and reset the upstream branch:
  $ git push origin -u <new_name>

  # Delete the <old_name> remote branch:
  $ git push origin --delete <old_name>
